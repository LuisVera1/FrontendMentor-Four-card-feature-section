## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Some time ago, I began this project from Frontend Mentor as a trial for Flexbox. However, I never got around to completing it.

Recently, I noticed that this unfinished challenge was still among my projects. Motivated by this realization, I decided to finally tackle it, striving for the closest possible match to the original design.

I used this project to experiment, I thought to do it with grid, but finally I
used flexbox to explore new ways, anyway I'm happy with the result.

### Continued development

I will continue to experiment and improve the structure of my code to make it
more maintainable.
